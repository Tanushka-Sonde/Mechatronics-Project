# Self-Cleaning Solar Panel Robot

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an automated system for cleaning solar panels to maintain high efficiency in energy production.

## Problem Statement
Solar panels are effective for converting solar energy into electricity but become less efficient when dust accumulates on their surface. Manual cleaning is feasible for small installations but impractical for large solar fields due to size and cost. Therefore, an automated, cost-effective solution is needed.

## Solution
We propose a robot equipped with:
- **Edge Detection Sensors**: To prevent falling off the panels.
- **Water Spraying System**: For cleaning.
- **Motors and Joints**: To move and control the cleaning mechanism.

## Mechatronics Architecture
The system comprises:
- **Track Frame**: Guides the movement of the cleaning mechanism.
- **Prismatic Joints**: Allow vertical movement.
- **Sensors**: Detect edges and obstacles.
- **Water Pump**: Sprays water for cleaning.
- **Motors**: Drive the movement and rotation of components.
