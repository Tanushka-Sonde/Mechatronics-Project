# Self-Cleaning Solar Panel Robot

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an robotic system for cleaning solar panels to maintain high efficiency in energy production.

## Problem Statement
Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells and are a key renewable energy source. However, dust accumulation on solar panels reduces their efficiency by up to 30%.  Figure below demonstrates the relation between efficiency and the density of dust on the solar panel.

In large solar fields spanning 10 to 200 acres, manual cleaning becomes impractical due to the size, cost, and time required. Therefore, an automated, reliable, and cost-effective solution is needed to clean the panels at regular intervals, with high precision and minimal energy consumption.

## Mechatronics Architecture
The system comprises:
- **Track Frame**: Guides the movement of the cleaning mechanism.
- **Prismatic Joints**: Allow vertical movement.
- **Sensors**: Detect edges and obstacles.
- **Water Pump**: Sprays water for cleaning.
- **Motors**: Drive the movement and rotation of components.

## Solution
We propose a robot equipped with:
- **Edge Detection Sensors**: To prevent falling off the panels.
- **Water Spraying System**: For cleaning.
- **Motors and Joints**: To move and control the cleaning mechanism.
