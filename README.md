Problem statement-

Solar panels are an effective and sustainable solution for converting solar energy into electricity using photovoltaic cells. Solar panels are a vital method of generating renewable energy due to their green, high-efficiency, and eco-friendly characteristics. With an installed capacity of 1053 GW in 2022, solar energy is the second most installed renewable energy technology.[1]

To maximise the efficiency of power generation, solar panels are kept in open areas. Due to air pollution, dust present in the air settles on the solar panels, forming a layer. This leads to a decrease in energy conversation efficiency by 30%. It is estimated that solar energy will provide 10% of global energy production by 2030, most of which will be produced in desert areas where the Sun shines. However, there is also a lot of dust in these areas, which reduces energy production by up to 30% per month. Fig1 below demonstrates the relation between efficiency and the density of dust on the solar panel.

On a small scale, such as for a single building, manual cleaning of solar panels might be feasible. However, it becomes impractical in a solar field spanning 10 to 200 acres due to the sheer size, personnel expenses, and time required. Therefore, a reliable, automated, and cost-effective solution is needed to clean the panels at regular intervals with precision and minimal energy consumption.
