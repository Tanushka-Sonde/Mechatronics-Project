# Mechatronics-Project
This repository contains the development of a self-cleaning solar panel robot, modeled after the SolarCleano B1. The robot automates the cleaning of large solar fields by integrating mechatronic components such as motors, prismatic joints, sensors, and a water spray system. The project is part of mechatronics course.
