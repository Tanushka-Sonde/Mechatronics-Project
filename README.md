# Self-Cleaning Solar Panel Robot

## Project Overview
In this project, we have developed a rover designed for cleaning solar panels to minimize human intervention. The rover incorporates advanced mechanisms and components to ensure efficient cleaning, reducing maintenance costs and improving the overall efficiency of solar panels.

# Features
- **Custom CAD Design:**  
  All structural components of the rover are designed in CAD, ensuring precision and modularity. These files are included in the repository for easy replication and customization.
  
- **Autonomous Movement:**  
  Equipped with a Raspberry Pi and servo motors, the rover can be controlled remotely.With its strong computing power when came across a solar panel can actually predicts whether the panel 
  which came across it is clean or dirty and cleans if its dirty.
  
- **Remote Control Interface:**  
  Operated via a Flask web server, allowing users to monitor and control the rover from any device with a web browser.

- **Compact and Lightweight:**  
  The roverâ€™s design ensures portability and minimal impact on the solar panel layout. After Assembly the rover will weigh 10kg at max.

# Repository Structure

1. **STL Files**  
   All 3D-printable components required to build our rover are provided in the `CAD` folder. Components include:  
   - Full base  
   - Bracket  
   - U frame  
   - Final  

2. **Source Code**  
   - `app.py`: The primary code for controlling servo motors which are connected to wheels.  
   - `trained.h`: This is the vgg18 model pretrained on imagenet and add a dense layer with softmax at the end for binary classification for clean and dirty. The dataset of 2390 images was used to train the model and 738 images we used to test our data to get 80% accuracy on the given dataset.

3. **Prototype Reference Images**  
   Find progress images of SPAC-R in the `Progress Images` folder:  
   - `Progress2.jpg`  
   - `Prototype Image.jpeg`  
   - Suction cup of the end effector: `image`  
   - `progress3.jpg`  
   - Final model image: `image`  

4. **Reference Videos**  
   Demonstrations of SPAC-R in action are located in the `Videos` folder:  
   - Initial prototype testing  
   - End effector rotation  
   - Suction assembly in operation  
   - Servo movement control  
   - Final prototype assembling a flower
